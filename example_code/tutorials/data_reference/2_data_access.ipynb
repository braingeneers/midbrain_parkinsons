Specifically, we describe how to download datasets from the braingeneers cloud, [the NRP](https://nationalresearchplatform.org/), into this codespace. Note that these necessary datasets have already been downloaded through code written in the `/.devcontainer/post_create.sh` files. These commands are more for if you want to download additional datasets or create your own. Be *very* careful when running these commands. You do not want to be the person that deletes an important dataset from the server. \n"

    "The braingeneers uses the [National Research Platform](https://nationalresearchplatform.org/) for all of our data storage and cloud computing needs. You can think of the NRP as our version of AWS. Here we will focus only on accessing data, and not [cloud computing](https://github.com/braingeneers/wiki/blob/main/shared/prp_quickstart.md). To keep things from getting messy, we organize all of our datasets according to a [specific protocol](https://github.com/braingeneers/wiki/blob/main/api_data/organizing-data.md). Data is then uploaded and downloaded [using S3](https://github.com/braingeneers/wiki/blob/main/shared/prp_storage.md). This notebooks shows how you can use S3 commands to access data using the terminal. If you check the S3 reference you'll find that there's there also other ways to access the datasets using python code with the braingeneers packages `smart_open` and `awscli`.\n"
